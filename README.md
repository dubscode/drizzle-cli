# Drizzle Deno CLI

A command-line interface tool for scaffolding Drizzle ORM files, compiled with Deno.

**Note:** This is an opinionated CLI tool that currently supports only PostgreSQL databases using Drizzle ORM. It assumes the use of relative imports with `@/`, similar to a Next.js application.

## Features

- Generate schema files for Drizzle ORM
- Create TypeScript types based on your schema
- Generate Zod validation schemas
- Scaffold CRUD API endpoints
- Customizable project structure through configuration
- **Optimized for projects using PostgreSQL and Next.js-style imports (`@/`)**

## Installation

The Drizzle Deno CLI is distributed as a pre-compiled executable, so you don't need to have Deno installed on your system to use it.

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/dubscode/drizzle-cli/releases) page of this repository.
2. Download the appropriate executable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Rename the downloaded file to `drizzle-cli` (or `drizzle-cli.exe` on Windows) for convenience.
4. Move the executable to a directory in your system's PATH.

## Setting up on your Mac

Move it to /usr/local/bin

```bash
sudo mv drizzle-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

Check if it's in your PATH

```bash
which drizzle-cli
```

Verify the version

```bash
drizzle-cli --version
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the Drizzle Deno CLI from your terminal:

1. Initialize the project configuration:

```
drizzle-cli init
```

2. Generate files for a new table/model:

```
drizzle-cli generate
```

3. View or update the CLI configuration:

```
drizzle-cli config
```

## Configuration

The CLI uses a configuration file named `drizzle-cli-config.ts` in your project root. This file is automatically generated when you run `drizzle-cli init`. You can manually edit this file or use the `drizzle-cli config` command to update your configuration.

## Limitations

- Supports **only** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Assumes relative imports using `@/` (e.g., `import { something } from '@/path/to/module'`)

## For Developers

If you want to contribute to the Drizzle Deno CLI or compile it yourself, you'll need to have Deno installed on your system. You can get it from [deno.land](https://deno.land/).

To compile the CLI:

```
deno compile --allow-read --allow-write --output drizzle-cli cli.ts
```

This will generate an executable named `drizzle-cli` (or `drizzle-cli.exe` on Windows) in your current directory.
